## About

When living together with someone who's doing shift work, it can be really difficult to keep track of your time together. Planning becomes a challenge.
Combine that with schedules on paper or PDF, which are hardly machine-readable. So the task to setup an accessible timetable falls to us puny humans! There already _is_ a free tool to share your timetables online, it's called Google Calendar. Best of all, you can have as many calendars as you like, share them with whomever you want and it's fully integrated in your phone calendar. Yay!

But creating events in a calendar is cumbersome work. This is where this app comes in! Calendarizator helps you creating sequences of events quickly.

## Tech

This app is built on Mato's awesome [angular-lazy](https://github.com/matoilic/generator-angular-lazy) and runs on [App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/). And of course, it uses the [Google Calendar API](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/), which is integrated using [maximepvrt/angular-google-gapi
](https://github.com/maximepvrt/angular-google-gapi).
